Annotations, a form of meta-data, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations have no effects on the operation of the code they annotate.

Annotation use scenario:

* Information for the compiler: used by the compiler to detect
* Compile-time and deployment-time processing: software tools can process annotation information to generate code. Enhance the ability of program.
* Run-time processing: annotation that examined at run-time
